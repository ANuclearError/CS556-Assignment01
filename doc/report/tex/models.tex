The first model that was attempted was linear regression, with the hope that it
would produce a strong model for predicting exact values. Since I was willing to
accept merely a `score grade' categorical value rather than the continuous score
rank, decision trees were also investigated.

\subsection{Linear Regression} % (fold)
\label{sub:linear_regression}
With linear regression, it was hoped that all of the numeric values in the
columns would help to create a strong model to predict score rank. The first
step taken was to determine whether or not the tags would prove useful as part
of this venture. In order to investigate, another model was created without the
use of tags to determine how much of a difference their inclusion made.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{img/pred.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{img/pred_b.png}
    \caption{Linear regression with and without tags}
\end{figure}

The results obtained from these two models are interesting. With tags, the
adjusted R-squared value is 0.4395 while it is 0.1053 when tags are omitted,
which suggests that the inclusion of tags does produce a more accurate model.
However, the RMSE value with tags is 51.7 while it is 29.3 for tags, which
suggests the opposite. This makes it difficult to truly determine which is
better.

The next step was to convert the predicted values into grade, to form a
confusion matrix to further investigate.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{| r | l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textbf{With tags}} &
    \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textbf{Without tags}} \\
    \hline
    Grade & False & True & False & True \\
    \hline
    0-10 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    10-20 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
    20-30 & 2 & 0 & 4 & 0 \\
    30-40 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    40-50 & 3 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\
    50-60 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
    60-70 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    70-80 & 2 & 2 & 5 & 1 \\
    80-90 & 3 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\
    90-100 & 1 & 1 & 5 & 0 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Confusion matrix for with and without tags linear regression}
\end{table}

Again, it is clear that linear regression works marginally better when the tags
are included, but it is evident that a strong model cannot be obtained from the
use of linear regression.

\subsection{Clustering} % (fold)
\label{sub:clustering}
Clustering techniques were used to determine if information could be obtained
to asst with helping predict score. The data was split into 6 clusters, and
depending on the clusters that would emerge, this would provide an idea on how
to move forward.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/clust_plot.png}
    \caption{The 6 clusters}
\end{figure}

However, the results obtained from the clustering did little to help with the
problem at hand. Looking at the cluster tree did provide some context as to what
the clusters were. Cluster 1 games were published by the same company and each
had a large number of players. Cluster 3 games were all role-playing games, all
with many users. Cluster 5 were all games that involved simulation and/or
strategy, while cluster six were all games that had first person camera
perspectives. The other 2 clusters appeared to be a random collection rather
than any meaningful clusters.

Again, it appeared that clustering the data would provide little help towards
discovering what gives games high review scores from users. It was at this point
where it seemed that trying to find any model would not be possible in the given
time period.
