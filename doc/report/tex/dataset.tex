\section{The Dataset} % (fold)
\label{sec:dataset}
The dataset being used is data taken from the top 100 most popular games on the
Steam platform during the fortnight period starting the 6th of February 2017.
This is determined by the number of users who have played the game during this
two week period. The data was obtained from the SteamSpy API, containing various
fields for the 100 games.

\subsection{Data Fields} % (fold)
\label{sub:data_fields}
The data has over 200 fields included, with the majority being based on the user
tag feature Steam offers, which presented a challenge in regards as to their use
in the project. The main fields of the dataset are:

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
		\hline
		Field & Description \\
		\hline
		AppID & The application ID. \\
		\hline
		Name & The name of the game. \\
		\hline
		Developer & A comma separated list of developers of the game. \\
		\hline
		Publisher & A comma separated list of publishers of the game. \\
		\hline
		Score Rank & The score rank of the game based on user reviews. A score
		rank of 75\% indicates that the game has better reviews than 75\% of
		Steam games. \\
		\hline
		\emph{Owners} & The estimated number of users who own the game. This
		figure can be inflated with free games or games being offered as a free
		weekend. \\
		\hline
		\emph{Players Forever} & The number of users who have played the game
		since March 2009. \\
		\hline
		\emph{Players 2 Weeks} & The number of users who have played the game in
		the two weeks period of this request. \\
		\hline
		Average Forever & Average playtime since March 2009 in minutes.\\
		\hline
		Average 2 Weeks & Average playtime in two weeks period in minutes. \\
		\hline
		Median Forever & Median playtime since March 2009 in minutes. \\
		\hline
		Median 2 Weeks & Median playtime in two weeks period in minutes. \\
		\hline
		CCU & The peak number of concurrent users playing the game the day
		before the request was made. \\
		\hline
		Price & The current price of the game in US cents. \\
		\hline
	\end{tabularx}
	\vspace{1ex}
\end{table}

It must be noted that for the Owners, Players Forever and Players 2 Weeks field
all include an additional field that denotes a variance on the figure within
said field, due to being estimations rather than the actual figure. For example,
the game Dota 2 has \(93\,965\,255\) owners with a variance of \(243\,479\),
meaning that the actual number of owners will lie somewhere in the range of
\(93\,965\,255 \pm 243\,479 \) owners. The same principle applies for the other
two fields.
