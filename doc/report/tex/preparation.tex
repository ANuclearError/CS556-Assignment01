\section{Data Preparation} % (fold)
\label{sec:preparation}
Before modelling, the data obtained from SteamSpy had to be cleansed and
modified to better suit the problem being investigated.

The AppID and Name fields were irrelevant, simply being IDs rather than actual
data. Therefore, it was ideal that they be removed from the dataset during the
modelling process.

\subsection{Categorising Score and Price} % (fold)
\label{sub:categorising_score_price}
The goal of the project is to create a model for estimating the ScoreRank
field. Thus, it maybe better to try and predict the score as a range, rather
than the specific value. In order to address this, additional columns were made
for `ScoreGrade' and `PriceBand'. ScoreGrade divides the ScoreRanks into ten
different grades, based on its score from 0-10, 10-20 and so on. This matches
up with the histogram shown in \fullref{fig:score_rank}.

The same principle was applied with PriceBand, which maps each price to a \$5
denomination. It should again be pointed out how this makes the lowest band
inflate in size to the number of free-to-play games in the dataset. It may be
ideal for this to be its own price band, rather than being merged with the paid
games less than \$5.
